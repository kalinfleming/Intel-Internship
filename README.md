Description: This program simulates an Airline website. The user can either be a customer or an administrator. The administrator
can create flights by inputting different flight descriptions. The program will store all flights into a text file named
"flights.txt". The administrator can also clear any previous reservations made by customers for all flights.
The customer can reserve a seat on a flight. The customer will be able to see a list of flights available
with the relevant descriptions and reserve a seat. If customers attempt to book the same seat in the same program simulation,
the customer will have to choose a different seat.
